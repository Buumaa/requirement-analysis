## Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.
## What is Requirement Analysis?


Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves understanding what the users want the system to do (functional requirements) and how the system should perform (non-functional requirements).

The goal is to create a clear, complete, and unambiguous set of requirements that guides the design, development, and testing of the system.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement analysis is a critical early phase in the software development lifecycle. Its importance includes:

1. Defining Clear Project Scope  
   - Clearly specifies what is in and out of the project.  
   - Helps in resource planning, budgeting, and scheduling.

2. Preventing Scope Creep  
   - Ensures only agreed-upon features are developed.  
   - Minimizes unplanned changes during development.

3. Improving Communication  
   - Serves as a reference point for developers, testers, and stakeholders.  
   - Reduces misunderstandings about system behavior.

4. Supporting Accurate Design and Development  
   - Developers rely on detailed requirements to create system architecture.  
   - Minimizes errors caused by assumptions or incomplete understanding.

5. Facilitating Testing and Validation  
   - Acceptance criteria derived from requirements guide the testing process.  
   - Ensures the final product meets stakeholder expectations.

6. Reducing Cost and Time  
   - Identifying requirements early reduces costly changes later.  
   - Helps in estimating effort, time, and budget more accurately.
  
### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

- Defines Clear Project Scope  
  - Requirement analysis clearly outlines what features and functionality are included in the project and what is not.  
  - This helps prevent misunderstandings and sets clear expectations for stakeholders and the development team.

- Prevents Scope Creep  
  - By documenting and agreeing on requirements upfront, unplanned or unnecessary features are minimized.  
  - This reduces delays, cost overruns, and project risks.

- Supports Accurate Design, Development, and Testing  
  - Developers and designers rely on well-analyzed requirements to create the system architecture and code.  
  - Testers use the requirements to develop test cases and validate that the system meets stakeholder expectations.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.

- Requirement Gathering  
  - Collecting information about what stakeholders need from the system.  
  - Sources include interviews, surveys, questionnaires, observations, and existing documentation.

- Requirement Elicitation  
  - Engaging with stakeholders to uncover explicit and implicit requirements.  
  - Techniques include brainstorming, workshops, prototyping, and use case discussions.

- Requirement Documentation  
  - Recording the requirements in a clear, structured, and accessible format.  
  - Typically results in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.

- Requirement Analysis and Modeling  
  - Examining requirements for feasibility, consistency, completeness, and clarity.  
  - Creating models like flowcharts, UML diagrams, or data models to visualize system behavior.

- Requirement Validation  
  - Ensuring that requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and expectations.  
  - Techniques include reviews, inspections, and prototyping to confirm correctness and completeness.

## Types of Requirements

1. Functional Requirements  
   Define what the system should do.  
   *Example:* “The system must allow users to reset their passwords via email.”

2. Non-Functional Requirements  
   Define how the system should perform, including qualities like performance, security, usability, scalability, and reliability.  
   *Example:* “The system should load pages within 2 seconds under normal load.”

3. Business Requirements  
   High-level goals of the organization that the software must support.  
   *Example:* “Increase online sales by 20% within a year.”

4. User Requirements  
   Needs and expectations from the user’s perspective.  
   *Example:* “The mobile app should work offline for at least 24 hours.”


## Types of Requirements

### Functional Requirements
Functional requirements describe what the system should do, specifying the tasks, features, and interactions the system must support.

Examples for a Booking Management Project:
- Users must be able to create, view, update, and cancel bookings.  
- The system should send confirmation emails to users after a successful booking.  
- Administrators should be able to generate booking reports and manage user accounts.  
- The system must allow searching for available slots or services based on date, time, or category.

### Non-Functional Requirements
Non-functional requirements define how the system should perform and the quality attributes it must meet, such as performance, security, and usability.

Examples for a Booking Management Project:
- The system should load pages within 3 seconds under normal traffic conditions.  
- User data must be securely stored and comply with data protection regulations.  
- The system should be available 99.9% of the time (high availability).  
- The interface should be intuitive and accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Use Case Diagrams

### What are Use Case Diagrams?
Use Case Diagrams are a visual representation of the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and the system itself.  
They help to identify who interacts with the system and what functionalities the system must provide.

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams:
- Provides a clear overview of system functionality.  
- Helps stakeholders and developers understand system requirements.  
- Assists in identifying all user interactions and edge cases.  
- Useful for planning test cases and validating requirements.

### Booking System Use Case Diagram
Actors:
- Customer: Creates, views, updates, or cancels bookings.  
- Administrator: Manages bookings, generates reports, manages users.  

Use Cases:
- Create Booking  
- View Booking  
- Update Booking  
- Cancel Booking  
- Generate Booking Reports  
- Manage Users  

Diagram Creation:
1. Use a tool like [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or Lucidchart.  
2. Add actors (Customer, Administrator) on the left/right.  
3. Add use cases in the system boundary (rectangle).  
4. Connect actors to the relevant use cases with lines.  
5. Export the diagram as PNG named alx-booking-uc.png.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Importance of Acceptance Criteria
Acceptance Criteria define the conditions that a feature must meet to be considered complete and acceptable by stakeholders. They are a key part of requirement analysis because they:  
- Ensure clarity and alignment between stakeholders, developers, and testers.  
- Serve as a reference point for testing and validation, helping to confirm that the feature works as intended.  
- Reduce misunderstandings and minimize the risk of incomplete or incorrect functionality.  
- Help manage scope by clearly defining what is included and what is not in a feature.

### Example: Checkout Feature in Booking Management System
Feature: Checkout  

Acceptance Criteria:  
- Users must be able to review their selected bookings before payment.  
- Users can enter and save payment details securely.  
- Payment processing should succeed only if all required fields are valid.  
- The system must display a confirmation message and send a confirmation email after successful payment.  
- If payment fails, an error message should be displayed with instructions to retry.  
- Users must be able to cancel the transaction before final confirmation.
