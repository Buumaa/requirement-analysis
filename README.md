## Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.
## What is Requirement Analysis?


Requirement analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It involves understanding what the users want the system to do (functional requirements) and how the system should perform (non-functional requirements).

The goal is to create a clear, complete, and unambiguous set of requirements that guides the design, development, and testing of the system.

Key activities in requirement analysis include:
- Requirement Gathering: Collecting requirements through interviews, surveys, observations, and document analysis.
- Requirement Specification: Documenting the requirements in a clear, structured format, often in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
- Requirement Validation: Ensuring requirements are feasible, complete, and aligned with stakeholder expectations.
- Requirement Prioritization: Determining which requirements are critical, optional, or nice-to-have.

## Types of Requirements

1. Functional Requirements  
   Define what the system should do.  
   *Example:* “The system must allow users to reset their passwords via email.”

2. Non-Functional Requirements  
   Define how the system should perform, including qualities like performance, security, usability, scalability, and reliability.  
   *Example:* “The system should load pages within 2 seconds under normal load.”

3. Business Requirements  
   High-level goals of the organization that the software must support.  
   *Example:* “Increase online sales by 20% within a year.”

4. User Requirements  
   Needs and expectations from the user’s perspective.  
   *Example:* “The mobile app should work offline for at least 24 hours.”

## Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC

Requirement analysis is a critical early phase in the software development lifecycle. Its importance includes:

1. Defining Clear Project Scope  
   - Clearly specifies what is in and out of the project.  
   - Helps in resource planning, budgeting, and scheduling.

2. Preventing Scope Creep  
   - Ensures only agreed-upon features are developed.  
   - Minimizes unplanned changes during development.

3. Improving Communication  
   - Serves as a reference point for developers, testers, and stakeholders.  
   - Reduces misunderstandings about system behavior.

4. Supporting Accurate Design and Development  
   - Developers rely on detailed requirements to create system architecture.  
   - Minimizes errors caused by assumptions or incomplete understanding.

5. Facilitating Testing and Validation  
   - Acceptance criteria derived from requirements guide the testing process.  
   - Ensures the final product meets stakeholder expectations.

6. Reducing Cost and Time  
   - Identifying requirements early reduces costly changes later.  
   - Helps in estimating effort, time, and budget more accurately.

## Conclusion

Requirement analysis is the foundation of any successful software project. By thoroughly understanding and documenting the needs of stakeholders, teams can ensure:  
- A well-defined project scope  
- Reduced risk of errors and scope creep  
- Clear guidance for design, development, and testing  
- Higher chances of delivering a system that satisfies users and business objectives
